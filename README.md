# Pistronics 3

Pistronics is a mod, which adds additional building options to minecraft.  
Options include moving and rotating block structures. Builds like elevators, swingdoors, quarries or robots become possible.  
The mod does so by adding blocks with simple functions, and it's up to the player to combine them and create complex builds.
(no "magic" or single purpose blocks)

__Pistronics3 is currently in developement.__
